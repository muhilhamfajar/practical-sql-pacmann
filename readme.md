# Used Car Sales Database Project

This project aims to create a relational database for a used car sales website. The website will allow users to list their used cars as advertisements and potential buyers can search for cars based on various criteria. The transaction process is not within the scope of this project.

### Features and Limitations
1. Any user can list more than one used car product.

2. Before listing a car, users must provide their personal information such as name, contact information, and location.

3. Users list their cars through advertisements displayed on the website.

4. Advertisements contain the title, detailed product information, and seller contact information.

5. Car information in the advertisement includes:
- Car brand (e.g., Toyota, Daihatsu, Honda, etc.)
- Model (e.g., Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla Altis, Toyota Vios, Toyota Camry Hybrid, etc.)
- Body type (e.g., MPV, SUV, Van, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.)
- Transmission type (manual or automatic)
- Year of manufacture (e.g., 2005, 2010, 2011, 2020)
Additional description (e.g., color, mileage, etc.), as needed.

6. Users can search for cars based on the seller's location, car brand, and body type.

7. If a potential buyer is interested in a car, they can place a bid if the seller allows bidding.

8. The actual purchase transaction is conducted outside the application and is not within the project's scope.

### Project Steps
1. Design a relational database based on the requirements provided.

2. Create the database using a suitable RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

3. Define tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints as needed.

4. Populate the database with dummy data for testing purposes.

5. Perform simple analysis on the dummy data.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) if not already installed.

2. Set up the database using the provided DDL scripts.

3. Populate the database with dummy data using the provided SQL scripts.

4. Execute queries to analyze the data, such as finding the most popular car brands, average prices by body type, or the number of cars listed by each user.
